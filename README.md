# ⚡ PowerStride – Sustainable Commuting App Concept

PowerStride is a sustainable feature prototype built as an extension of the Leap Top-Up App in Dublin. It uses **piezoelectric flooring** inside public buses to **convert passenger footfall into electric energy**, rewarding users with Leap top-up credits when energy milestones (1000 kWh) are hit.

This prototype was developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and includes a login system, interactive GUI controls, energy calculation features, and DOM manipulation.
